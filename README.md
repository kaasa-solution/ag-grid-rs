# ag-grid-rs

A wrapper crate providing Wasm bindings for the [AG Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/) JavaScript table library.

## Usage

ag-grid-rs aims to follow the API of AG Grid in an unsurprising way, and makes heavy use of the builder pattern for constructing the Rust structures.

```rust
use ag_grid_rs::GridOptions;

// TODO: an example using Yew
```
